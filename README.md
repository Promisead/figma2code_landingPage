## About the Project

This project was initiated as a challenge to design a Figma landing page website from scratch for all screen types. The design was then converted into a functional working website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Design System:** Defined colors, components, and assets that form a cohesive design system.
- **Interactive Elements:** Includes interactive components built with JavaScript.

## Design System

The design system was meticulously created in Figma, defining all colors, components, and assets. You can find the Figma design file and all related assets in the `figma_design` directory of this repository.
